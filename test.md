# Test Document: VB-FORWARDER-003

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level test plan for the Python scripts for file monitoring, concatenation, and uploading (VB-FORWARDER-002). The scripts are designed to monitor specific file types in a directory, concatenate their contents into a single HTML file, and upload this file to an SFTP server every 10 seconds. Additionally, the scripts host the HTML file on a local HTTP server.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of testing are to verify:

1. The scripts correctly monitor the directory for specific file types (`.txt`, `.py`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`).
2. The scripts correctly concatenate the contents of the monitored files into an HTML file (`latestcode.html`).
3. The scripts correctly upload the HTML file to the SFTP server every 10 seconds.
4. The scripts correctly host the `latestcode.html` file on a local HTTP server.
5. Error handling works correctly when connecting to the SFTP server or uploading the file.

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 File Monitoring and Concatenation

1. **Test Case 1.1:** Create a file of each supported type in the directory and verify that their contents are correctly concatenated into `latestcode.html`.

2. **Test Case 1.2:** Modify a file in the directory and verify that the changes are correctly reflected in `latestcode.html`.

### 3.2 File Uploading

1. **Test Case 2.1:** Verify that `latestcode.html` is correctly uploaded to the SFTP server every 10 seconds.

2. **Test Case 2.2:** Disconnect from the internet and verify that an error message is printed to the console.

3. **Test Case 2.3:** Change the password in `credentials.txt` to an incorrect password and verify that an error message is printed to the console.

### 3.3 HTTP Server

1. **Test Case 3.1:** Access `localhost:8000/latestcode.html` in a web browser and verify that the file is correctly served.

## 4. Test Data

The test data consists of the files in the directory and the SFTP server details in `credentials.txt`.

## 5. Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the functionality of the Python scripts for file monitoring, concatenation, and uploading. By following this plan, we can ensure that the scripts function correctly under a variety of conditions and handle errors as expected.
